# BattleBoss

My first arcade videogame created with pygame basics.

The game consists of defeating enemies while dodging their attacks and launching your attacks to lower their life.
Defeating enemies you will earn gold, you can use it to improve your strength and your life.
Both you and your enemy have two types of attacks, the basic attack and the final one that will cost you gold but does more damage.
